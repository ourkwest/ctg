Layer rotating tiles in front of all other tiles.

Level editor? (handmade levels are kind of tedious right now)

Level transitions. Zoom, pan, rotate ?

No flow while tile is spinning? Currently flow begins for new position as soon as tile starts turning.



Level transitions:

    add 'empty' shapes to levels?

    lock level on completion
    fade shapes to empty on completion

    lock level
    fade shapes away and only render outlines
    cross-fade:
        position,
        rotation,
        scale,
        fg + bg colours,
        which outlines are being drawn
    fade new shapes in from outlines
